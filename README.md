# My First dbt Project  

This repository contains my first **dbt (data build tool)** project, which I am working on as part of the **dbt Fundamentals** course. The goal of this project is to understand dbt workflows, connect to Amazon Redshift, build transformations in SQL, and implement best practices for analytics engineering.
